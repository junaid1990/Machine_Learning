    "# Logistic Regression in Machine Learning\n",
    "- popular Machine Learning algorithms of Supervised Learning technique. \n",
    "- It is used for predicting the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.\n",
    "- the outcome must be a categorical or discrete value. It can be either Yes or No, 0 or 1, true or False, etc. but instead of giving the exact value as 0 and 1, it gives the probabilistic values which lie between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- similar to the Linear Regression but Logistic regression is used for solving the classification problems.\n",
    "- In Logistic regression, instead of fitting a regression line, we fit an \"S\" shaped logistic function, which predicts two maximum values (0 or 1).\n",
    "- The curve from the logistic function indicates the likelihood of something such as whether the cells are cancerous or not, a mouse is obese or not based on its weight, etc.\n",

    "## Logistic Function (Sigmoid Function):\n",
    "- The sigmoid function is a mathematical function used to map the predicted values to probabilities.\n",
    "- It maps any real value into another value within a range of 0 and 1.\n",
    "- The value of the logistic regression must be between 0 and 1, which cannot go beyond this limit, so it forms a curve like the \"S\" form. The S-form curve is called the Sigmoid function or the logistic function.\n",
    "- In logistic regression, we use the concept of the threshold value, which defines the probability of either 0 or 1. Such as values above the threshold value tends to 1, and a value below the threshold values tends to 0."
